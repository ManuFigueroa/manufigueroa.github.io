	<p class="intro">I'm Manuel Figueroa, a 6th year student of Computer Science at UTFSM in Santiago, Chile. This dev blog was created for my videogame design course.</p>
	<p align="justify">Its purpose is to show the process of creating different videogame prototypes, and hopefully make some useful tutorials for those who know very little about making videogames, like me.</p>
